        clam help me to become a solution oriented indivisual.I prefer to live in a confined and diciplined environment .With the growing world i have tried to walk 
    with it and giving myself exposer to various technical skils and courses of my own interest.In my leisure time i take interest in playing chess ,research 
and learning more about my culture.At last , I would like to mention that never give up at any situation and have tried to become my own motivation. </p>
